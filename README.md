### 📡 IoT Sensor Dashboard
- Real-time monitoring of **9 sensor metrics**:
  - Soil: Nitrogen, Phosphorus, Potassium, pH, Moisture
  - Environment: Temperature, Humidity, Light Intensity, Rainfall
- Color-coded status: Optimal / Caution / Alert
- Auto-refresh every 5 s with threshold-based alert system and historical tracking

### 🏛️ Government Portal Hub *(NEW)*

Central hub linking all 5 Indian government agricultural portals from one screen:

| Module | Portal | What it does |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| 📊 Mandi Prices | eNAM + Agmarknet | Live commodity prices, cross-mandi comparison, price trends, seasonal calendar, market alerts |
| 📜 Scheme Checker | myScheme | Farmer fills profile → AI matches eligible government schemes and subsidies |
| 🛡️ Crop Insurance | PMFBY | Premium calculator (crop/season/area), claim status tracker, enrollment deadlines |

### 🌐 Multi-Language Support *(NEW)*

Full UI available in **5 languages** — every screen, label, button, and error message:

| Flag | Language |
|------|----------|
| 🇬🇧 | English |
| 🇮🇳 | Hindi (हिन्दी) |
| 🇮🇳 | Punjabi (ਪੰਜਾਬੀ) |

- **Languages**: English, Hindi, Punjabi, Tamil, Bengali
- **Scope**: All 9 screens, every label, button, tooltip, and message
- **Switching**: Language picker in app bar → instant UI update via `ValueListenableBuilder`
- **Architecture**: Single `lang_provider.dart` with all translations in one map (~1200 lines)

## 🎨 Design System

| Element | Value |
|---------|-------|
| Primary Green | `#2ecc71` |
| Dark Green | `#27ae60` |
| Background | `#FAFAF5` |
| Alert Red | `#e74c3c` |
| Warning Amber | `#E9A23B` |

## 🧪 Testing the API

```bash
# Health check
curl http://localhost:5000/health

# Crop prediction
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/predict_crop \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"nitrogen":60,"phosphorus":25,"potassium":45,"temperature":28,"humidity":75,"ph":7.0,"rainfall":215}'

# Mandi prices — Wheat in Punjab
curl "http://localhost:5000/api/govt/mandi/prices?state=Punjab&commodity=Wheat"

# Scheme eligibility
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/govt/schemes/check \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"age":35,"land_acres":2.5,"state":"Punjab","gender":"male","farmer_type":"small"}'

# PMFBY premium
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/govt/insurance/premium \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"crop":"Wheat","season":"Rabi","area_acres":2.0}'

# mKisan advisories
curl "http://localhost:5000/api/govt/advisory/feed?category=weather&state=Punjab"
```

## 🐳 Docker

```dockerfile
FROM python:3.11-slim
WORKDIR /app
COPY requirements.txt .
RUN pip install -r requirements.txt
COPY . .
EXPOSE 5000
CMD ["python", "app.py"]
```

```bash
docker build -t agroguard-backend .
docker run -p 5000:5000 agroguard-backend
```

---

## ☁️ Cloud Deployment

```bash
# Heroku
heroku create agroguard-api && git push heroku main

# Google Cloud Run
gcloud run deploy agroguard-api --source .

# Flutter Web
flutter build web --release
# → deploy build/web/ to Firebase Hosting, Netlify, or Vercel

# Android
flutter build appbundle --release

# iOS
flutter build ios --release
```

---

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

| Issue | Fix |
|-------|-----|
| Connection refused | Check backend is running: `curl http://localhost:5000/health` |
| Govt data not loading | Check internet; SQLite cache serves as fallback |
| Image picker not working | Add permissions to `AndroidManifest.xml` / `Info.plist` |
| Language not changing | Ensure `ValueListenableBuilder` wraps the full widget tree |
| TensorFlow not found | Python 3.13 is unsupported by TF; disease detection uses mock fallback |
